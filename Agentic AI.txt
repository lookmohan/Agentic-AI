In traditional software, and even earlier AI , followed fixed rules and workflows. They execute what we told them step by step

AGENTIC AI CHANGES THAT. Instead of following scripts, these system can take a goal you provide and pursue it in flexible, adaptive ways. They can plan, make choices, adapt to obstacles, and act — all in service of the objective you’ve set.

🎯 What is Agentic AI? (The Simple Answer)
Traditional AI/Software: "Follow my exact instructions, step by step"
Agentic AI: "Here's my goal - figure out how to achieve it"
Think of it like the difference between:

Recipe follower (traditional) - follows steps exactly
Chef (agentic) - knows the goal (make dinner), decides what to cook, adapts if ingredients are missing

3 types
1. LLM.
What it is: A predefined pipeline where YOU decide all the steps
Real-world example:
Customer asks question 
    ↓
Search company knowledge base
    ↓
Feed results to ChatGPT
    ↓
Return formatted answer
Key point: The AI doesn't decide what to do - YOU programmed every step. But it still feels smart!

When to use:
Customer support bots
Document summarizers
Report generators
Most production AI systems (because they're reliable and cheap!)

2. Single Agent Systems.
What it is: The AI makes its OWN decisions about what to do next
Real-world example - Travel Planning Agent:
USER: "Plan a 3-day trip to Paris under $2000"

AGENT THINKS:
- "I need to search for flights first" → uses flight search tool
- "Hmm, flights are expensive. Let me check hotels" → uses hotel search
- "Budget is tight. Let me find free activities" → searches tourist sites
- "Now I'll create an itinerary" → generates final plan
Key difference from workflows: The agent CHOSE which tools to use and in what order. You didn't program that - it figured it out!
The OODA Loop (how agents think):

Observe - Look at the situation ("User wants Paris trip")
Orient - Understand what matters ("Budget is tight")
Decide - Pick next action ("Search cheap flights first")
Act - Do it ("Call flight API")
Loop back - Check result and decide again

3. Multi Agent Systems.
An agent has these superpowers:
1. Planning
Can break big goals into smaller steps
Goal: "Write a research report on AI"
Plan: 
  1. Search for recent AI papers
  2. Summarize key findings
  3. Organize by topic
  4. Write introduction and conclusion
2. Decision Making
Chooses what to do based on the situation
If search returns nothing → try different keywords
If source is unreliable → find better source
If information is outdated → search for newer data
3. Tool Use
Can use different tools as needed:

Web search
Calculators
Databases
APIs
Code execution
File systems

4. Adaptation
If something fails, tries a different approach
Tried Google Search → failed
→ Let me try Wikipedia instead
→ Still not enough
→ Let me search academic databases


✨ Quick Mental Models
Workflow = Assembly line (same steps, every time)
Agent = Problem solver (figures out the steps)
Multi-Agent = Company (specialized teams working together)


Questions to think about:

Is ChatGPT a workflow or agent? (Hint: It's mostly a workflow with some agent-like features!)
Would you build a calculator as an agent or workflow? (Workflow - it's simple and predictable!)
Would you build a trip planner as an agent or workflow? (Agent - needs flexibility!)
